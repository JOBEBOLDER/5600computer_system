# CS 5600 Fall 2025 Lab 2

## Deliverable
We will grade the `shell56.c` file (see below) in your Khoury GitHub repository.

NOTE - REMOVE ALL DEBUG PRINTFS WHEN YOUR DONE OR TESTS WILL FAIL

E.g. the assignment states that the output from `pwd` will be the name of the current directory, 
not multiple lines of debug output followed by the current directory. 

## Assignment
See the file "assignment.pdf" in this repo; it's also available on Piazza.

## Repo contents
You are given the following files:

* `parser.c`, `parser.h` – command-line parser that handles quotes, etc.
* `shell56.c` – skeleton code for your shell
* `Makefile` – to build it. (with two targets – “shell56” (default) and “clean”)
* `assignment.pdf` - specifics of the assignment and lots of instructions

## Gradescope tester
As with Lab 1, there will be a gradescope tester which runs the grading tests against your code. 
There is a 4-hour lockout - after getting your results, I expect you to do your own fixing 
and debugging before submitting again.

The output from the tester is not as helpful as it could be; I will be posting additional
information on Piazza to help you decipher its error messages.
